# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a content-based movie recommendation system built with Python, Pandas, and Streamlit. It uses the TMDB Movie Metadata dataset for movie information. The app uses a preprocessed dataset (movie_dict.pkl) and a similarity matrix (similarity.pkl) to suggest movies based on user-selected titles. The web interface is simple and user-friendly.
